## Creating a Discord Bot to Give NERSC Status
Following tutorial on [Creating a Discord Bot](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/creating-discord-bot/).
1. In Discord, go to your profile's Settings.
2. Under Advanced, activate Developer mode.
3. Open up the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers) and navigate in the left-hand navigation bar to the "Applications" page.
4. Create your bot. Make sure to uncheck the "Public Bot" option, since we don't want this to go anywhere except our server.

At this point, I realized I'd need to install a package in Python to program the bot, and I quit. Here's the tutorial I would follow on [programming the bot in Python](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/discord-bot-python).
